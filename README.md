Application framework for ruby. Focus is on system administration, but provides plenty of convenience classes for working with ruby in general. Susu builds on Thor and Active Support, so it won't reinvent stuff those libraries already provide.

## Dependencies

Even though you don't have to use it, I recommend using Thor to build the command line interface to your applications, especially if you are new to ruby.

### Runtime
- active_support
- awesome_print
- hashie

### Development
- thor
- test/unit
