# Susu_Ruby_Options

A mixin module for adding options to a class or module.

## Dependencies

- Susu Ruby CoreExtend
- Hashie

You don't need to do anything for this dependency if you include Options through Susu Ruby, but if you want 
to include it in your project without including Susu Ruby, you should also include CoreExtend and make sure
both libs are included.
